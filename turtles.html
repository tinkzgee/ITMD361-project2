  <h3>Red-eared sliders</h3>
  <p>I have four of these aquatic turtles they live in water. My first turtle was found at a pond and given to me. My other two turtles used to be my uncle's but he couldn't take care of them and gave them to me in 2013. I basically took in all my turtles except the most recent one I bought it in 2016 from Chinatown.</p>
  <h3>Tortoise</h3>
  <p>I have two tortoises, one female and one male. I named them Pizza Prince and Pizza Princess because at the time I was a junior in highschool and ate pizza every single day.</p>
  <p>A great website to buy turtle care products or for other pets is <a href="https://www.chewy.com/" target=" _blank">Chewy's</a>.</p>
